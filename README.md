# AI Model Basics

An interactive slideshow presentation that explains how modern AI models are built, trained, and used. This educational tool breaks down complex concepts into digestible slides covering architecture, training, inference, and advanced capabilities.

## Overview

This presentation covers 24 comprehensive topics about AI models, from the basics of Transformers to advanced concepts like RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows. Each slide includes:

- Clear explanations with analogies
- Key concepts and bullet points
- Visual callouts (insights, analogies, notes)
- Curated resources (videos, articles, tools)

## Features

- **Interactive Navigation**: Navigate slides with arrow keys, buttons, or touch gestures
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing your position in the presentation
- **URL Hash Support**: Direct links to specific slides via URL hash
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, minimalist design with smooth transitions
